# Screenshot For Blocked
A simple Twitter bot for screenshotting tweets from users who blocked you.
There are two use-cases:
1. User A retweeted User B. <br>
Let's assume that for some unknown reason, User B blocked you. <br>
Now you can tag the bot (https://twitter.com/blocked_screen) and it will comment the blocked tweet.
2. User A commented on a tweet by User B. <br>
Again, for some unknown reason, User B blocked you. <br>
Tag the bot as a comment to the comment of User A, and it will comment the blocked comment.
